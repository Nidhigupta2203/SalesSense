# SalesSense  
### Intelligent Sales Forecasting using Time Series & Machine Learning

SalesSense is an end-to-end **sales forecasting system** that analyzes historical sales data and predicts future demand using **time series feature engineering**, **machine learning models**, and an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory planning, revenue estimation, and business decision-making.  
SalesSense demonstrates how raw time-series data can be transformed into a supervised learning problem and solved using both **traditional ML models** and **deep learning**.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle:
- Data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training & evaluation
- Future forecasting
- Deployment using Streamlit

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network)**

Each model learns temporal patterns from historical sales data and is evaluated using regression metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

- Synthetic daily sales data (1 year)
- Columns:
  - `date` — Date of observation
  - `sales` — Daily sales value
- Synthetic data is used to simulate real-world sales trends and seasonality.

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

The following time-series features were created:

- Lag features:
  - `lag_1`, `lag_2`, `lag_3`
- Rolling statistics:
  - Rolling mean
  - Rolling standard deviation
- Calendar feature:
  - Day of week

Rows containing missing values generated by lag operations were removed.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

These metrics help compare accuracy and robustness across models.

## 🔮 Future Forecasting

SalesSense supports:
- **7-day**
- **30-day**

future sales forecasting using **recursive prediction**, where each predicted value is fed back as input to forecast subsequent time steps.

## 🖥 Streamlit Dashboard Features

- Interactive model selection:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LSTM
- Historical sales visualization
- Actual vs predicted sales comparison
- Future sales forecasting (7 / 30 days)
- Robust file-path handling for deployment

## 🧪 Key Learnings

- Time-series data can be converted into supervised learning problems using lag features
- Recursive forecasting is required for multi-step future prediction
- Feature consistency between training and inference is critical
- Tree-based ML models and LSTM capture time dependencies differently
- Streamlit enables rapid deployment of ML applications

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add external variables (holidays, promotions)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Confidence intervals for forecasts
- Automated retraining pipeline
- Cloud deployment
